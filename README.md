# avocet

A Visualisation Of Collected Enteresting [*sic*] Things (avocet) is a single page web app written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) that displays various user defined information in JSON as cards (like a status board).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [elm-mdl](https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/),
[elm-decode-pipeline](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline), and better understanding of [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).

### Project

The app accepts a JSON resource URL and displays the information as cards using the [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) design language. The screenshot of the app:
